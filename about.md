Welcome to my tech blog! This is a place for me to pen down my learnings.

### Short Bio

As a data scientist, I implement data science applications for companies through the use of open-sourced frameworks. For machine-learning, I utilize [deep-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [boosted trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), and [factorization machines](http://www.libfm.org), depending on the use case. For productionizing, I utilize a collection of other technologies such as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com), among others.

As an investor, I manage money by investing across global equities, bonds, commodities, and foreign currencies. I focus on both [strategic asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategicassetallocation.asp) and [tactical asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tacticalassetallocation.asp). To date, I have achieved an annualized [time-weighted total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-weightedror.asp) of 7.41% since inception in July 2016. To view my investment performance in more detail, feel free to click on the [investments section](https://wngaw.github.io/investments).

If you need help in building data science applications, or struggle to understand investments and personal finance, feel free to reach out to me.
