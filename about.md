Welcome to my tech blog! This is a place for me to pen down my learnings.

### Short Bio

As a data scientist, I build data science products using open-sourced frameworks. For machine-learning, I utilize [deep-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [boosted trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), [factorization machines](http://www.libfm.org), and [Apache Spark's MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/), depending on the use case. For deployment, I utilize a collection of other technologies such as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com), among others. I am experienced in using both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

As an investor, I manage money by investing across global equities, bonds, commodities, and foreign currencies. I focus on both [strategic asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategicassetallocation.asp) and [tactical asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tacticalassetallocation.asp). To date, I have achieved an annualized [time-weighted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-weightedror.asp) total return of 7.41% since inception in July 2016. To view my investment performance in more detail, feel free to click on the [investments section](https://wngaw.github.io/investments).

If you need help in building data science applications, or struggle to understand investments and personal finance, feel free to reach out to me.
