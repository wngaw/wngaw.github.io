Welcome to my tech blog!

### Short Bio

As a data scientist, I focus on building data science products. For modeling, I often utilise regression (linear, logistic, spline), deep learning (word2vec, DeepWalk, wide & deep, transfer learning), ensemble methods (random forest, gradient boosting, stacking), factorization machines, and Apache Spark’s MLlib, depending on the use case. For deployment, I utilize a collection of other technologies such as Airflow, Jenkins, Kubernetes, MLflow, Spring Boot, Docker, and Git, among others. I am experienced in using both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

As an investor, I manage money by investing across global equities, bonds, commodities, and foreign currencies. I focus on both [strategic asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategicassetallocation.asp) and [tactical asset allocation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tacticalassetallocation.asp). To date, I have achieved an annualized [time-weighted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-weightedror.asp) total return of 6.42% since inception in July 2016. To view my investment performance in more detail, feel free to click on the [investments section](https://wngaw.github.io/investments).

Academically, I am trained in Statistics and Finance at NUS and NTU, respectively.

I am a Singapore citizen based in Singapore.

If you need help in building data science products, or struggle to understand investments and personal finance, feel free to reach out to me.
