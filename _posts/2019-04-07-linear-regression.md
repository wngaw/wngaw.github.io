As a data scientist, often you will be required to explain how a learning algorithm works. Hence, it is very important to understand the mechanics behind them.

## What is linear regression?

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts a real-valued output based on input values. Univariate linear regression refers to a linear regression with only one variable. Multivariate linear regression refers to a linear regression with more than one variables.

## Hypothesis

The objective of a linear regression is to learn a function that predicts the dependent variable.

This hypothesis is typically represented by the following function:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{h}_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1(x_1) \ldots + \theta_n(x_n)
\end{align}
$$

## Cost function

A cost function measures the prediction accuracy of the hypothesis. For linear regression, a common cost function is the $$\textit{mean squared error}$$, which calculates the average squared distances between the predicted values and actual values.

$$
\begin{align}
J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) = \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^m (\text{h}_\theta(x^i) - y^i )
\end{align}
$$

The overall objective is to minimise the cost function by iterating through different values of $$\theta$$. The lowest possible value of the cost function is also known as the global minimum. The final linear regression model will hold the valuee of $$\theta$$ that yields the lowest cost function.

$$
\underset{\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n}{\min} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n)
$$

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an algorithm used to estimate the parameters required to minimize the cost function.

Typically, gradient descent starts with randomly initialized values of $$\theta$$. After which, $$\theta$$ is being updated iteratively using gradient descent untill the cost function $$J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n)$$ ends up at a minimum.

The gradient descent algorithm is as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{repeat until convergence}\left \{ \\
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
\right \}
\end{align}
$$

where

- values of $$j = 0, 1,\ \;dots,\ n$$
- $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate

Each value of $$\theta$$ is simultaneously updated using gradient descent untill the cost function stops decreasing.

To correctly implement simultaneous update, it is important to calculate all values of $$\theta$$ before updating the new values of $$\theta$$.

Correct implementation of simultaneous update:

$$
\text{temp}_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
\text{temp}_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
... \\
\text{temp}_n := \theta_n - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_n} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\

\theta_0 := \text{temp}_0 \\
\theta_1 := \text{temp}_1 \\
... \\
\theta_n := \text{temp}_n 
$$

Wrong implementation of simulataneous update:

$$
\text{temp}_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
\theta_0 := \text{temp}_0 \\
\text{temp}_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
\theta_1 := \text{temp}_1 \\
... \\
\text{temp}_n := \theta_n - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_n} J(\theta_0,\ \ldots,\ \theta_n) \\
\theta_n := \text{temp}_n 
$$

By taking the derivative of the cost function, we can find out which direction to move in order to reduce the cost function. The size of each step is determined by the learning rate $$\alpha$$.

To understand this concept, suppose we have a cost function $$J(\theta_0)$$ with just one parameter to optimize.

If $$\theta$$ is more than the optimal value of $$\theta$$ (at the global minimum), then the derivative of the cost function with be positive. Hence the value of $$\theta$$ will be updated by subtracting a positive number. This ensures that the new $$\theta$$ is lower in value.

In contrast, if $$\theta$$ is less than the optimal value of $$\theta$$, then the value of $$\theta$$ will be updated by adding a positive number, ensuring that the new $$\theta$$ is larger in value.

<br />

However, this does not always ensure that $$\theta$$ converges. If the learning rate is too large, the updated value of $$\theta$$ might go beyond the optimal value of $$theta$$ at the global minimum.

## Local Minimum vs Global Minimum

Even when the values of $$\theta$$ converges, we need to be aware that the cost function might not be at the global minima. That is, there could be another combination of $$\theta$$ values where the value of cost function is even lower.

This means the values of $$\theta$$ is stuck at a local minima.

<br />

To counter this problem many different methods of gradient descent have been created in order to allow the algorithm to escape from the local minima to reach a better minimum. One of the popular variant of gradient descent is $$\textit{stochastic gradient descent}$$.
