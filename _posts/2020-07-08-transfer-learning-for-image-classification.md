Image classification is one of the areas of deep learning that has developed very rapidly over the last decade. However, due to limited computation resources and training data, many companies found it difficult to train a good image classification model. Therefore, one of the emerging techniques that overcomes this barrier is the concept of transfer learning.

## What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained classification model, extracting one of the layers, then taking that as the input layer to a series of dense layers. The pre-trained model is usually trained by institutions or companies that have much larger computation and financial resources. Some of these popular trained models for image recognition tasks are VGG, Inception and ResNet.

Using this newly formed model, we can then set the parameters within the pre-trained model to be non-trainable while only optimizing the parameters of the subsequent dense layers during training.

In order to illustrate the value of transfer learning, I will be comparing a simple convolutional neural network model against a model that utilises transfer learning in the following examples.

## Implementation

The following sections will be focusing on implementation using Python.


### Dataset

Before I go into the comparison, I will like to introduct you to the [Fashion MNist dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). This dataset consist of 10 different apparel classes, each of them is a 28x28 grayscale image. Fashion MNist was created for categorical image classification making it ideal for the task that we are trying accomplish.

Note that you will have to download the images as PNG files for the following examples. Please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/DeepLenin/fashion-mnist_png) for the steps to obtain the dataset.

### Import Libraries

Let's start off by importing the necessary libraries

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Defining data generators

```python
train_dir = 'data/train'
validation_dir = 'data/test'

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,
                                   rotation_range=40,
                                   width_shift_range=0.2,
                                   height_shift_range=0.2,
                                   zoom_range=0.2,
                                   shear_range=0.2,
                                   horizontal_flip=True,
                                   fill_mode='nearest')  # with data augmentation

test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)  # no augmentation for test set

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(train_dir,
                                                    batch_size=100,
                                                    class_mode='categorical',
                                                    target_size=(150, 150))


validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(validation_dir,
                                                        batch_size=100,
                                                        class_mode='categorical',
                                                        target_size=(150, 150))
```

### Define a Callback to stop training after certain performance is achieved

```python
class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
        if(logs.get('acc') > 0.99 and logs.get('val_acc') > 0.99):
            print("\nCancelling training as model has reached 99% accuracy and 99% validation accuracy!")
            self.model.stop_training = True
```

### Define function to plot result

```python
def plot_result(history):
    acc = history.history['accuracy']
    val_acc = history.history['val_accuracy']
    loss = history.history['loss']
    val_loss = history.history['val_loss']

    epochs = range(len(acc))

    plt.plot(epochs, acc, 'r', label='Training accuracy')
    plt.plot(epochs, val_acc, 'b', label='Validation accuracy')
    plt.title('Training and validation accuracy')
    plt.legend(loc=0)
    plt.figure()
    plt.show()
```

### Simple Convolutional Neural Network

For the simple CNN model, I will be having 3 convolutional layers followed by a single dense layer and the output layer.

#### Defining CNN model

```python
img_width, img_height = 150, 150

if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
    input_shape = (3, img_width, img_height)
else:
    input_shape = (img_width, img_height, 3)

inputs = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

x = layers.Conv2D(32, (2, 2), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)

x = layers.Conv2D(32, (2, 2), activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)

x = layers.Conv2D(64, (2, 2), activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)

x = layers.Flatten()(x)

x = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)

outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.compile(optimizer=RMSprop(lr=0.0001),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### Model summary

```python
model.summary()
```

#### Fitting the model

```python
callbacks = myCallback()
history = model.fit_generator(train_generator,
                              validation_data=validation_generator,
                              steps_per_epoch=100,
                              epochs=10,
                              validation_steps=100,
                              verbose=2,
                              callbacks=[callbacks])
```

#### Plotting model training and validation result

```python
plot_result(history)
```

![cnn_model_result]({{ '/images/cnn_model_result.png' | relative_url }})
<br />
*Fig. 1. CNN Model Result*
<br />

Using a simple CNN model, we are able to achieve a validation accuracy of 0.7 after 10 epochs. Can we do better using transfer learning?

### Transfer Learning using Inception v3

Inception is a convolutional neural network architecture introduced by Google which achieved top results in ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014.

<br />

#### Download model weights, import model, load weights into model

```python
# Download Inception v3 weights to local machine
!wget --no-check-certificate \
    https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/inception_v3_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5 \
    -O /tmp/inception_v3_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5

# Import Inception v3 Model
from tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3
pre_trained_model = InceptionV3(input_shape=(150, 150, 3), include_top=False, weights=None)

# Load Inception v3 weights into model
local_weights_file = '/tmp/inception_v3_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5'
pre_trained_model.load_weights(local_weights_file)
```

#### Set layers to be non-trainable for pre-trained model

```python
for layer in pre_trained_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
```

#### Model summary of Inception v3

```python
pre_trained_model.summary()
```

#### Obtain last layer output of the pre-trained model

```python
last_layer = pre_trained_model.get_layer('mixed7')
last_output = last_layer.output
```

#### Adding dense layers after pre-trained model

```python
x = layers.Flatten()(last_output)
x = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)
x = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(pre_trained_model.input, x)

model.compile(optimizer=RMSprop(lr=0.0001),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### Model summary of Inception v3 with dense layers

```python
model.summary()
```

#### Fitting the model

```python
callbacks = myCallback()
history = model.fit_generator(train_generator,
                              validation_data=validation_generator,
                              steps_per_epoch=100,
                              epochs=10,
                              validation_steps=100,
                              verbose=2,
                              callbacks=[callbacks])
```

#### Plotting model training and validation result

```python
plot_result(history)
```

![inception_v3_model_result]({{ '/images/inception_v3_model_result.png' | relative_url }})
<br />
*Fig. 3. Inception v3 Model Result*
<br />

As you can see, using Inception v3 for transfer learning, we are able to obtain a validation accuracy of 0.8 after 10 epochs.

## Remarks

In this simple example, we can see how transfer learning is able outperform a simple CNN model for the Fashion MNist dataset. In real-life, most of our images are often more difficult to classify. Therefore, being able to leverage on a pre-trained model is really a big step forward for the community!
